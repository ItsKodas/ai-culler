# AI Culler — Arma 3 Server Performance Mod

A lightweight server-side mod that intelligently manages AI simulation across all factions based on player proximity and line of sight. Designed for large milsim ops with 60+ players and high AI counts.

---

## The Problem

Arma 3 simulates every AI unit simultaneously on a fixed cycle. Beyond ~150 units this causes periodic frame spikes as the server chokes on the processing load — even with LAMBS and Headless Clients.

## The Solution

AI Culler caps the number of actively simulating units and prioritises which ones matter most using a three-tier system:

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Always cull | Beyond faction cull distance | Always disabled |
| 🟡 Cap dependent | In range, no player LOS | Disabled only if over cap |
| 🟢 Never cull | In range, player has LOS | Always active |

Vehicles are never culled regardless of distance or LOS.

---

## Installation

1. Copy the `@ai_culler` folder into your Arma 3 directory
2. Add `-mod=@ai_culler` to your **server** and **Zeus client** launch parameters
3. No mission changes required — no `init.sqf` entry needed

---

## Configuration

### Mid-op (Zeus settings panel)

Open Zeus → click **"Settings"** in the status window to adjust values live without restarting:

| Field | Variable | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Max AI | `AIC_maxActiveAI` | 80 |
| Dist OPFOR | `AIC_distOpfor` | 1000m |
| Dist Indep | `AIC_distIndependent` | 800m |
| Dist Civ | `AIC_distCivilian` | 400m |
| Interval(s) | `AIC_checkInterval` | 5s |

Changes take effect on the next culler tick. Values sync to all connected Zeus clients via `publicVariable`.

### Pre-op (edit defaults)

To change the defaults that load at mission start, edit `@ai_culler/addons/aic_main/functions/fnc_preInit.sqf` and rebuild the PBO:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AIC_maxActiveAI` | 80 | Hard cap on simultaneously active AI |
| `AIC_distOpfor` | 1000m | Cull distance for Opfor (east) |
| `AIC_distIndependent` | 800m | Cull distance for Independent |
| `AIC_distCivilian` | 400m | Cull distance for Civilians |
| `AIC_checkInterval` | 5s | How often the culler runs |
| `AIC_debug` | true | RPT logging — set to `false` for live ops |

## Zeus Usage

**At placement:** A "Protect from culler" checkbox appears in the Zeus placement panel for infantry. Tick it before confirming placement — that unit will never be culled.

> ⚠️ Requires Config Viewer verification before use — see `config.cpp` comments for details.

**On existing units:** Right-click any living AI infantry unit in Zeus → **"Toggle Culler Protection"**. Confirmation appears in system chat.

**Status window:** Opens automatically when Zeus is active. Displays live stats — Active, LOS, No-LOS, Culled, Protected. Click ▲/▼ to collapse or expand.

- **Disable Culler / Enable Culler** — pauses and resumes culling entirely. All previously culled AI are re-enabled when disabled.
- **Settings** — expands an inline panel to adjust Max AI, cull distances, and check interval live. Click Apply to push changes to the server immediately.
